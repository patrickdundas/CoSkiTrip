## Development Roadmap
[ ] Better sorting of route lane direction - "Both Directions" first, then a definite order of N/E/S/W  
[ ] Sort incidents by last updated time  
[ ] Filtering of certain incidents to "notifications" for conciseness, such as "chain law enforced" or "MEXL Open"  
[ ] Ask the community what data they would find useful (destinations, routes, etc)  
[ ] Go live in /r/COSnow
